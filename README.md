# Web API Reference Application

A simple .NET Core Web API application to demonstrate how to connect to various backend data sources (SOAP, REST, RDBMS, etc.)

## Connecting to a SOAP Service

This example uses the [`SoapHttpClient`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/SoapHttpClient/) and borrows heavily from [that project's documentation](https://github.com/pmorelli92/SoapHttpClient). It shows how to connect to NASA's Heliocentric Trajectories Web Services and uses the [`Newtonsoft.Json` package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Newtonsoft.Json/) to convert the XML SOAP response to JSON format.

## Connecting to a REST Service

Coming soon.

## Connecting to a RDBMS

Coming soon.
